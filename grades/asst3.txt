  D3. Note that the TLB miss can also be caused by the instruction itself being
      on a page that is not memory-resident.

  M1. a. It'll be once per allocation also.

Design document: 23/30
  - Thorough coverage of fault control flow.
  - You don't cover synch for writeback, handling ELF segments and permissions,
    or AS routines in any detail---talking about the data structures for these
    problems more would also have been good.

Implementation: 50/60
  - /testbin/badcall fails on open(); probably an A2 problem.
  - fork() runs out of memory for /testbin/randcall; probably a leak, maybe
    VM-related.
  - All of the triplefoo tests only work if you use enough memory that swapping
    isn't an issue---you have some synch issue with swap, most likely.
  - /testbin/malloctest 6 fails (TLB modify trap panic)
