  - 1.6. Your answer describes the functions but doesn't truly explain why the
         functionality can't be totally shared: i.e., due to the need to
         validate pointers and fail gracefully on error.  The actually copying
         can be done by something like memmove(); in fact, memcpy() is used.
  - 1.7. More that it's to prevent you from treating pointers into user memory
         as valid kernel pointers (which encompasses all other pointer types).
  - 3.1. There share dispatch control flow, not actually the same
         post-compilation instructions.  SYSCALL() generates that code during
         preprocessing.
