A sample of our tests was selected and compiled together under tests.sh for submission.

Please note that unless sfsck is modified, the blocks that are marked for our journal
will be incorrectly deteremined to be "erroneously shown allocated in bitmap" by sfsck.
By default, we reserve 513 blocks for the journal, but this can easily be changed by
modifying sfs.h.
